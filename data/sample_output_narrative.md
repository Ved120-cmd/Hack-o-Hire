3. NARRATIVE
   The institution's monitoring systems identified suspicious financial activity associated with
   customer CUST-2024-78432. During the observation period of 7 days (10 January 2024 to
   17 January 2024), the customer's savings account (ACC-001-SAV) received approximately
   ₹45,62,500 in credits from 47 unique counterparties.

   The credits were structured in amounts ranging from ₹91,000 to ₹99,500, consistently
   remaining below the ₹1,00,000 reporting threshold, suggesting deliberate structuring
   to avoid detection. The counterparties span multiple banks including SBI, HDFC, ICICI,
   Axis Bank, PNB, Bank of Baroda, Kotak, and others, with funds received via NEFT and
   IMPS channels. No clear business relationship or legitimate purpose has been identified
   for these receipts.

   On 17 January 2024, within approximately 24 hours of the final consolidation of funds,
   three large outward remittances were executed:
   - ₹45,00,000 to Premier Holdings Ltd, HSBC Dubai, UAE (SWIFT)
   - ₹2,50,000 to Global Ventures BVI, Standard Chartered, British Virgin Islands (SWIFT)
   - ₹1,50,000 to Apex Trade Pte, DBS Singapore, Singapore (SWIFT)

   These transfers represent approximately 107% of the total credited amount, effectively
   draining the aggregated funds to offshore jurisdictions associated with heightened
   money laundering risk (UAE, BVI, and Singapore).

   The customer's declared occupation is Software Developer with an annual income of ₹8,00,000.
   The transaction volume of ₹45,62,500 within a single week represents approximately 570%
   of the declared annual income, which is grossly inconsistent with the customer's known
   economic profile. No clear business justification has been provided for these transactions.
