On February 4, 2025, President Trump issued National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM2) announcing a maximum pressure campaign against Iran with the goals of denying Iran nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs); countering its development of other weapons capabilities; neutralizing Iran’s network and campaign of regional aggression; and disrupting, degrading, and denying Iran, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),1 and its terrorist proxies, access to the resources that sustain their destabilizing activities.2 To support the implementation of NSPM-2, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has issued several rounds of",

It is being issued concurrent with OFAC’s June 6 sanctions action, the first such action targeting an Iranian “shadow banking” network since the issuance of NSPM-2.5 This Advisory is also consistent with FinCEN’s National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Priorities, which include",
