    "content": "The purpose of the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is to report known or suspected violations\nof law or suspicious activity observed by financial institutions subject to the regulations of the\nBank Secrecy Act (BSA). In many instances, SARs have been instrumental in enabling law\nenforcement to initiate or supplement major money laundering or terrorist financing\ninvestigations and other criminal cases. Information provided in SAR forms also presents the\nDepartment of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) with a method\nof identifying emerging trends and patterns associated with financial crimes. The information\nabout those trends and patterns is vital to law enforcement agencies and provides valuable\nfeedback to financial institutions.1",

Unfortunately, some financial institutions file SAR forms that contain incomplete,\nincorrect, and/or disorganized narratives, making further analysis difficult, if not impossible.\nSome SAR forms are submitted with blank narratives. The failure to adequately describe the\nfactors making the transaction or activity suspicious undermines the very purpose of the SAR\nand lessens its usefulness to law enforcement. Because the SAR narrative serves as the only free\ntext area for summarizing suspicious activity, it is essential that financial institutions’ staff write\nnarratives that are clear, concise, and thorough.\nAlso, late filings, absence of supplementary SARs, and/or inaccuracies in SARs have an impact\nupon law enforcement’s ability to determine whether a crime was committed or continues to be",
