This advisory should be shared with: • Private Banking Units • Chief Risk Officers • Chief Compliance Officers • AML/BSA Analysts • Sanctions Analysts • Legal Departments Background The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this advisory to alert financial institutions of the increasing risk that proceeds of political corruption from Nicaragua may enter or traverse the U.S. financial system. In particular, FinCEN expects that senior foreign political figures1 1. “The term ‘senior foreign political figure’ as defined in 31 CFR § 1010.605(p) is a current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military or judicial branches of a foreign government (whether",

For the purposes of this definition, ‘senior official or executive’ means an individual with substantial authority over policy, operations, or the use of government-owned resources; and ‘immediate family member’ means spouses, parents, siblings, children and a spouse’s parents and siblings.” See 31 CFR § 1010.605(p).

FinCEN requests that financial institutions file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), consistent with their existing Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations, when they identify potential misuse of Nicaraguan public funds or potential proceeds of political corruption associated with senior foreign political figures connected to the Ortega regime. In its June 2018 “Advisory on Human Rights Abuses Enabled by Corrupt Senior Foreign Political Figures and Their Financial Facilitators,” FinCEN identified typologies and red flags illustrating how corrupt senior foreign political figures and their facilitators access the U.S. financial system to obscure and launder the",

Targeted Financial Sanctions against Corruption and Human Rights Abuse in Nicaragua The U.S. Government has strongly condemned the ongoing violence in Nicaragua perpetrated by the Ortega regime, the regime’s corruption, and the human rights abuses committed by the Ortega regime in response to civilian protests.3 3. See “Statement from the Press Secretary on Nicaragua,” July 30, 2018. This condemnation coincides with a broader effort to combat serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world using, among other mechanisms, the Global Magnitsky sanctions program, which is administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) under the authority of Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights and Accountability Act.

See Executive Order 13818, December 20, 2017. Rivas resigned from the Supreme Electoral Council in May 2018.

Most recently, in July 2018, OFAC designated Nicaraguan National Police Commissioner Francisco Javier Diaz Madriz and Secretary of the Mayor’s Office of Managua Fidel Antonio Moreno Briones for being responsible for, or the leaders of entities involved in, serious human rights abuse in Nicaragua. OFAC also designated Jose Francisco Lopez Centeno, the Vice President of ALBA de Nicaragua (ALBANISA), the company that imports and sells Venezuelan petroleum products, and thenPresident of Petronic, the Nicaraguan state-owned oil company, for engaging in corrupt activities.6 6.

For example, Moreno has been accused of stealing large sums of money from Managua municipal projects, as well as using municipal funds to pay for Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party activities. Lopez maintained access to large amounts of government funds that he could exploit, including for the personal use of Nicaraguan leaders. Lopez also syphoned funds from infrastructure projects by negotiating personal fees, placed numerous individuals throughout the government who have helped him steal millions of dollars on an annual basis, and used his position to his and his family’s benefit by using companies they own to win",
