See, FinCEN (June, 2010) Advisory FIN-2010-A007: “Newly Released Mexican Regulations Imposing Restrictions on Mexican Banks for Transactions in U.S. Currency.” 2. See, FinCEN (April, 2011) Advisory FIN-2011-A009: “Information on Narcotics and Bulk Currency Corridors” and (July, 2012) Advisory FIN-2012-A006: “Update on U.S. Currency Restrictions in Mexico.” Restrictions on USD cash transactions in Mexico may have led criminal actors to use additional schemes, such as using “funnel accounts” in conjunction with trade-based money laundering, to launder illicit proceeds. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this update to advise financial institutions on the increased use of funnel accounts as part of trade-based money laundering conducted by criminal actors following the restrictions on U.S. currency transactions in Mexico. This Advisory provides “red flags”",

Funnel Account: An individual or business account in one geographic area that receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, and from which the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between the deposits and withdrawals. Background In June 2010, the Mexican government announced regulations limiting deposits of U.S. cash in Mexican banks.1 Several months later, the Mexican government expanded the restrictions to include cash deposits made at exchange houses (casas de cambio) and brokerages (casas de bolsa). In 2011 and 2012, FinCEN issued two advisories that detailed the rise of funnel account use (also known as interstate or out-of-state funnel account activity) as a technique employed by individuals seeking to move illicit",

In some instances, multiple funnel accounts have been observed to transfer funds into a single consolidated account from where the funds are subsequently withdrawn.

Money brokers or peso brokers are third parties that seek to purchase drug proceeds located in the United States from Mexican cartels at a discounted rate. Once purchased, money brokers take possession of the drug proceeds that are, in turn, frequently sold to Mexican based businesses seeking U.S. dollars to buy goods from businesses in the United States and in other countries. Schemes such as the use of funnel accounts and TBML are a money laundering concern for both the U.S. and Mexican governments.

The deposits are kept below $10,000 in order for transactors to avoid identification and record keeping requirements.

The peso broker subsequently directs the deposit of narcotics proceeds into the funnel account and makes payments from this account for the purchase of U.S. and foreign goods.",
