Opioids are substances that target opioid receptors in the brain to cause analgesic and anesthetic effects and can pose a high risk of abuse, addiction, and overdose. Opioids can be sourced from natural, semi-synthetic (derived from natural opioids and opiates), or synthetic origins. Synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and its analogues, are created using precursor chemicals and target the same opioid receptors in the brain as natural opioids. Fentanyl is approximately one hundred times more potent of an analgesic than morphine and fifty times more potent an analgesic than heroin.
