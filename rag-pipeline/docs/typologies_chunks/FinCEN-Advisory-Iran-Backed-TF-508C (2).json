Iran seeks, among other goals, to project power by exporting terrorism throughout the Middle East and beyond through the financing of a range of regional armed groups, some of which are U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorist organizations (SDGTs).2 These terrorist organizations include Lebanese Hizballah (Hizballah),3 Hamas,4 1.
