This Notice provides financial institutions with specific suspicious activity report (SAR) filing instructions, and highlights some financial trends related to OCSE. Crimes related to OCSE, including the funding, production, and distribution of child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to multiple law enforcement authorities. This increase in activity is likely due to a confluence of factors, including: (1) increased internet usage by children who are spending more time online, both unsupervised and during traditional school hours; (2) restricted travel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in more sex offenders being online; and (3) increased access to and use of technology, including",

FinCEN performed a review of OCSE-related SARs and observed the following trends. Between 2017 and 2020, there was a 147 percent increase in OCSE-related SAR filings, including a 17 percent year-over-year increase in 2020. FinCEN also observed that OCSE offenders are increasingly 1.

The grooming process fosters a false sense of trust and authority over a child in order to desensitize or break down a child´s resistance to sexual abuse. See DOJ CEOS, “Child Pornography,” (Updated May 28, 2020). NCMEC has received reports that include instances of a child being groomed to sell or trade the child’s sexual images or accept other incentives, such as gift cards.

In the narrative, FinCEN requests that filers further address the details of the reported activity. When reporting OCSE-related activity, the inclusion of relevant technical cyber indicators (e.g., chat logs, IP addresses, email addresses, filenames, and CVC addresses, such as bitcoin) is invaluable for locating and investigating the criminals perpetrating activity and thus critical to law enforcement. 7. OCSE does not necessarily indicate human trafficking or smuggling, but may overlap with regard to certain offenses noted in FinCEN’s Human Trafficking Advisories, such as 18 U.S. Code § 1591 (sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion), 18 U.S. Code § 2423 (transportation of minors), and 18 U.S. Code § 2422 (coercion and enticement).
