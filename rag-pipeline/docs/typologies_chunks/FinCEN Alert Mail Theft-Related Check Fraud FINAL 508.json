Mail theft-related check fraud generally pertains to the fraudulent negotiation of checks stolen from the U.S. Mail. Fraud, including check fraud, is the largest source of illicit proceeds in the United States and represents one of the most significant money laundering threats to the United States, as highlighted in the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s most recent National Money Laundering Risk Assessment and National Strategy for Combatting Terrorist and other Illicit Financing.3 Fraud is also one of the anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) National Priorities.4 FinCEN is issuing this alert in close collaboration with the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS)5",

There have been cases of Postal Service employees stealing checks at USPS sorting and distribution facilities.11 However, according to USPIS, mail theft-related check fraud is increasingly committed by non-USPS employees, ranging from individual fraudsters to organized criminal groups comprised of the organizers of the criminal scheme, recruiters, check washers, and money mules. 6.
