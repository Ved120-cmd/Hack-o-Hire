The TCOs use proceeds from timeshare fraud to diversify their revenue streams and finance other criminal activities, including the manufacturing and trafficking of illicit",

See 31 U.S.C. § 5312(a)(2); 31 CFR § 1010.100(t). 2. According to the American Resort Development Association, a trade association for the timeshare industry, timesharing “describes a method of use and/or shared ownership of vacation real estate where purchasers acquire a period of time (often a week) in a condominium, apartment or other type of vacation accommodation.” See generally American Resort Development Association, Timeshare Terminology. 3. This joint Notice focuses on how TCOs are targeting U.S. owners of timeshares in Mexico. However, FinCEN is also aware of timeshare fraud schemes that defraud U.S. owners of timeshares in the United States. See generally Federal Trade Commission (FTC), “Timeshares, Vacation Clubs, and Related Scams” (Dec. 2023). 4. CJNG is a Mexico-based TCO and drug trafficking organization",

CJNG is a Mexico-based TCO and drug trafficking organization based in the Mexican state of Jalisco with strongholds in many cities and towns associated with Mexico’s tourism industry, such as Puerto Vallarta. According to U.S. law enforcement, CJNG is one of the predominant Mexico-based TCOs perpetrating timeshare fraud schemes. CJNG is also one of the TCOs that is primarily responsible for trafficking the majority of illicit fentanyl into the United States. Countering the CJNG and other Mexico-based TCOs is a top priority of the U.S. Government.

As highlighted by Treasury in the 2024 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment, fraud of all kinds continues to be the largest source of illicit proceeds in the United States, with timeshare fraud and elder financial exploitation (EFE) becoming an increasing money laundering threat to the U.S. financial system.8 As identified by FinCEN, combating fraud and TCO activity are U.S. Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) National Priorities.9 Treasury is a key implementer of whole-of-government efforts to combat illicit finance associated with TCOs, including the operating capital needed to sustain the illicit fentanyl supply chain.10 Pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14059, OFAC",

Methodologies of Timeshare Fraud Schemes in Mexico According to the FBI, Mexico-based TCOs are targeting U.S. owners of timeshares in Mexico through complex, often yearslong telemarketing scams.13 These schemes operate in TCO-controlled call centers in Mexico staffed by telemarketers14 who are fluent in English (hereafter “scammers”). CJNG-controlled call centers are generally located in Jalisco, Mexico. Victims of these schemes can include any U.S. owners of timeshares in Mexico,15 but, according to the FBI, older adults",

The price a TCO will pay for a timeshare owner’s personally identifiable information (PII) often corresponds with the value of the owner’s timeshare interests. After obtaining information on timeshare owners, the TCOs, through their scammers, contact victims by phone or email and claim to be U.S.-based third-party timeshare brokers, attorneys, or sales representatives in the timeshare, travel, real estate, or financial services industries.17 In some cases, scammers impersonate representatives of well-known U.S.-based timeshare, travel, real estate, or financial services companies.

Initial Timeshare Pitch After establishing trust and credibility with timeshare owners, scammers will claim to represent ready buyers, renters, or investors and then exploit victims’ trust through timeshare exit, re-rent, and investment scams.19 13.
