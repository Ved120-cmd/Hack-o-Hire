Introduction The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this advisory to alert financial institutions to potential indicators of cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many illicit actors are engaged in fraudulent schemes that exploit vulnerabilities created by the pandemic. This advisory contains descriptions of COVID-19-related malicious cyber activity and scams, associated financial red flag indicators, and information on reporting suspicious activity. This advisory is intended to aid financial institutions in detecting, preventing, and reporting potential COVID19-related criminal activity. This advisory is based on FinCEN’s analysis of COVID-19-related information obtained from Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) data, open source reporting, and law enforcement partners. FinCEN will continue issuing COVID-19-related information to financial",

F I N C E N A D V I S O R Y 2 Financial Red Flag Indicators of Cybercrime and Cyber-Enabled Crime Exploiting COVID-19 This advisory addresses the primary means by which cybercriminals and malicious state actors are increasingly exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic in cyber-enabled crime through malware and phishing schemes, extortion, business email compromise (BEC) fraud, and exploitation of remote applications, especially against financial and healthcare systems.1 1.

FinCEN has identified the following red flag indicators of COVID-19 cyber-enabled crimes to assist financial institutions in detecting, preventing, and reporting suspicious transactions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. As no single financial red flag indicator is necessarily indicative of illicit or suspicious activity, financial institutions should consider additional contextual information and the surrounding facts and circumstances, such as a customer’s historical financial activity, whether the transactions are in line with prevailing business practices, and whether the customer exhibits multiple indicators, before determining if a transaction is suspicious or otherwise indicative of potential fraudulent COVID-19-related activities. In line with their risk-based approach to compliance with the BSA, financial institutions are also encouraged to",

BEC criminals often use spoofed or compromised email accounts to communicate these urgent, last-minute payment changes. In the COVID-19 environment, criminals insert themselves into communications by impersonating a critical player in a business relationship or transaction, typically posing as providers of healthcare supplies, to intercept or fraudulently induce a payment for critically needed supplies.17 17.
