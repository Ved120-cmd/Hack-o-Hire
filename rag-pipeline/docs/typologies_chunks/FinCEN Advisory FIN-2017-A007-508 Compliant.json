This Advisory should be shared with: • Chief Risk Officers • Chief Compliance Officers • Legal Departments • AML/BSA Departments • AML/BSA Analysts • Fraud Departments The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this advisory to warn financial institutions about the potential for fraudulent transactions in the wake of disasters, including recent hurricanes and wild fires. This advisory is not intended to deter legitimate donations and relief assistance efforts. Rather, the purpose is to help financial institutions identify and prevent fraudulent activity that may interfere with legitimate relief efforts. The U.S. Department of Justice established the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) to investigate, prosecute, and deter fraud in the wake of Hurricane",

See https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/authorities-announce-formation-working-group-fight-hurricane-harveyrelated-illegal Its mission has expanded to include suspected fraud from any natural or manmade disaster, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. More than 30 federal, state, and local agencies participate in the NCDF, which allows the NCDF to act as a centralized clearinghouse of information related to disaster relief fraud of all types. Financial institutions are encouraged to use the resources made available by the NCDF to help identify and mitigate their potential for all types of disaster fraud risks. Potential Frauds While there are many indicators of general fraud, financial institutions should pay particular attention to benefits fraud, charities fraud, and cyber-related",

    "content": "institutions should pay particular attention to benefits fraud, charities fraud, and cyber-related fraud. Benefits Fraud Benefits fraud typically occurs when individuals apply for emergency assistance benefits to which they are not entitled. Financial institutions are at risk when fraudsters seek to deposit or obtain cash derived from the emergency assistance payments. FinCEN has noted an increase in the use of wire transfers to perpetrate these frauds. In those situations, requests for withdrawals are made and funds are wired to bank accounts, where the fraudster immediately withdraws the funds. 1 F I N C E N A D V I S O R Y 2 The NCDF has identified certain possible signs of fraudulent activity that may assist financial institutions in identifying and combating hurricane-related benefit fraud, including the following red flags: Deposits of multiple Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Red Cross, or other emergency assistance checks or electronic funds transfers into the same",

The presence or absence of a red flag in any given transaction is not by itself determinative of whether a transaction is suspicious. Financial institutions should take into account all relevant details of a customer or transaction and should not necessarily presume suspicious activity based on a single red flag. Charities Fraud Charities provide a vehicle for donations",

However, during times of disaster, criminals seek to exploit these vehicles for their own gain. Both legitimate and fraudulent contribution solicitations and schemes can originate from social media, e-mails, websites, door-todoor collections, flyers, mailings, telephone calls, and other similar methods. In the coming weeks and months, it is likely that millions of aid dollars will flow to areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. To ensure those contributions end up where donors intend, and not in the hands of criminals, the NCDF has identified possible signs of fraudulent activity to assist financial institutions in identifying and combating hurricane-related charities fraud,2 2.

F I N C E N A D V I S O R Y 3 Cyber-Related Fraud Cyber actors take advantage of public interest during natural disasters in order to conduct financial fraud and disseminate malware. The Center for Internet Security expects this trend to continue as new and recycled scams emerge involving financial fraud and malware related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. As of September 2017, the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) observed the registration of more than 743 domain names containing the word “Irma,” and most include a combination of the words “help,” “relief,” “victims,”",

Cyber actors often create such sites using web designs or names that are virtually identical to legitimate charities and relief organizations to induce unwitting donors into making donations to criminal enterprises through these fraudulent sites. These fraudulent websites often end with a “.com” or a “.net”, while most legitimate charities’ websites end in “.org”. For example, www.

When evaluating potential suspicious activity, financial institutions should also be mindful that some red flags may be observed during general transactional monitoring, whereas others may be more readily identified during in-depth case reviews.
