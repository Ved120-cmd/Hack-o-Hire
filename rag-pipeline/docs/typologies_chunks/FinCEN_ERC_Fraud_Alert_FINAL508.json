The tax quarter and date are reflected in the lower left of the check and appear consecutively. An example would include “12/2021 F-941” for ERC checks that reflect claims filed for the last tax quarter of 2021, using a Form 941 (“Identifying the ERC”).

F I N C E N A L E R T 7 Financial Red Flag Indicators of ERC Fraud FinCEN, in coordination with CI, has identified the following financial red flag indicators to assist financial institutions in detecting, preventing, and reporting suspicious transactions associated with ERC fraud, many of which overlap with red flags of financial crimes related to Economic Impact Payments authorized under the CARES Act.36 Because no single financial red flag indicator is determinative of illicit or suspicious activity, financial institutions should consider the surrounding facts and circumstances, such as a customer’s",

A business account receives more than one ERC check deposit over multiple days. Small business accounts receive an ERC check deposit that is not commensurate with the size of the business, the number of employees, and the volume of transactions.37 A large ERC is deposited into a business account and is subsequently transferred using P2P services or to an online banking institution, or withdrawn as cash at an ATM. Funds may be subsequently transferred from the account into separate accounts or payments may be made to new businesses that a customer has not had transactions with prior to receiving an ERC check deposit.

The account receiving an ERC check deposit has no deposits other than Treasury-issued checks, or the account has no regular business transactions.38 A customer attempts to deposit an altered Treasury ERC check, or financial institutions are unable to verify the validity of the checks that customers attempt to deposit.39 The ERC check is deposited into a new business account that did not exist in 2020 or 2021. A new business account is created for an established business, but no other business activity occurs in the account except the deposit of the ERC. This may be indicative of identity theft, where the established business was used as a fraudulent front to file for the ERC. A dormant business account suddenly receives an ERC check deposit. An ERC is deposited into a business account with no payroll history. 36. See “Advisory on Financial Crimes Targeting COVID-19 Economic Impact Payments,” supra Note 9, at p. 2. 37. The",
