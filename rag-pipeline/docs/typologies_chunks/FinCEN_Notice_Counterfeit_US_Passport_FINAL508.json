Since 2018, DSS has identified a concerning increase in the use of counterfeit U.S. passport cards by individuals and fraud rings to gain access to victim accounts at financial institutions nationwide. This fraud occurs in person at financial institutions and involves an individual impersonating a victim by using a counterfeit U.S. passport card that contains the victim’s actual information.",

DSS assesses that from 2018 to 2023, these schemes have resulted in $10 million in actual losses and $8 million in additional attempted losses, with over 4,000 victims in the United States. However, DSS and other law enforcement agencies assess that losses associated with U.S. passport card fraud and associated identity theft are likely significantly greater and seek increased reporting by financial institutions to identify additional illicit activity. FinCEN is issuing this Notice to ensure that financial institutions identify and report suspicious activity potentially related to U.S. passport card fraud. This Notice: (i) provides an overview of several typologies related to U.S. passport card fraud; (ii) highlights select technical, behavioral, and financial red flags to assist financial institutions in identifying and reporting suspicious activity; and (iii) reminds financial",

U.S. Passport cards are also significantly cheaper to counterfeit compared to U.S. passport books.8 4. Fraud, to include identity theft, was the most reported typology in BSA reports throughout 2021. Additionally, identity-related suspicious activity accounted for approximately 42% of total BSA reports and $212 billion in activity, and approximately 69% of these BSA reports indicate the use of impersonation to defraud victims.

The illicit actors may avoid branches of the financial institution the victim frequents to evade detection by employees who may be familiar with, or recognize, the victim. If the illicit actor’s identity is called into question by financial institution staff and they are asked to present a second form of identification, they may present a counterfeit credit card bearing the name of the victim they are impersonating as proof of identity. 9.

They selected customers with sizeable balances at Chase and created counterfeit passport cards using the customers’ names and identifying information but with conspirators’ photographs. Using those counterfeit passport cards, conspirators imitating the bank customers opened fraudulent joint bank accounts with other conspirators acting as money mules.
