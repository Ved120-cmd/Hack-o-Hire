See, St. Kitts-Nevis Citizenship by Investment Home Page, available at http://ciu.gov.kn/. Passports Obtained Through St. Kitts and Nevis Citizenship-by-Investment Program Used to Facilitate Financial Crime The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this Advisory to alert financial institutions that certain foreign individuals are abusing the Citizenshipby-Investment program sponsored by the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis (SKN) to obtain SKN passports for the purpose of engaging in illicit financial activity. Financial institutions can mitigate exposure to such risk through customer due diligence, including risk-based identity verification consistent with existing customer identification program requirements.1 The SKN Citizenship-by-Investment program offers citizenship to a non-citizen who either",

    "content": "The SKN Citizenship-by-Investment program offers citizenship to a non-citizen who either invests in designated real estate with a value of at least $400,000 USD, or contributes $250,000 USD to the St. Kitts and Nevis Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation.2 FinCEN believes that illicit actors are abusing this program to acquire SKN citizenship in order to mask their identity and geographic background for the purpose of evading U.S. or international sanctions or engaging in other financial crime. For example, FinCEN believes that several Iranian nationals designated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have obtained passports issued through the SKN Citizenshipby-Investment program. While many countries offer programs similar to the SKN Citizenship-by-Investment program, the SKN program is attractive to illicit actors because the program, as administered, maintains lax controls as to who may be granted citizenship. While the SKN government has publicly pledged to improve",

    "content": "as to who may be granted citizenship. While the SKN government has publicly pledged to improve these controls, FinCEN believes that they remain ineffective. For example, in 2013 the SKN government announced that all Iranian nationals were suspended from participating in the SKN Citizenship-by-Investment program. Despite this public assurance, FinCEN believes that Iranian nationals continue to obtain passports issued through the program. As a result of these lax controls, illicit actors, including individuals intending to use the secondary citizenship to evade sanctions, can obtain an SKN passport with relative ease. 2 F I N C E N A D V I S O R Y Guidance Financial institutions should conduct risk-based customer due diligence to mitigate the risk that a customer is disguising his or her identity with an SKN passport in order to evade sanctions or engage in other financial crime. This due diligence may include verifying the customer’s identity using a form of government-issued",
