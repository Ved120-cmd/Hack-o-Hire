These networks can be extensive and complex and include individuals who may, among other functions, organize the initial travel arrangements, facilitate lodging, and provide services to guide or facilitate the actual crossing of the SW border. These networks often are associated in some way with transnational criminal organizations (TCO), such as drug cartels that “control” territory through which smuggling operations take place.

These TCOs are also suspected of being involved with a number of other crimes, including human trafficking, narcotics trafficking, and murder.24 Human smuggling involves two main phases: solicitation and transportation.25 During the solicitation phase, smugglers advertise their services, for example, by posing as seemingly legitimate businesses such as travel agencies or work recruiters, and build trust with migrants seeking smuggling services. Smugglers acting in a solicitation role will often share the same national origin or related ethnic background as the migrants they smuggle.26 Historically, much of the solicitation was done by word of mouth, but with the rapid development of social media and other technology, smugglers have been able to leverage various platforms to reach a broader audience and potential pool of migrants.27 F I N C E N A L E R",

One example involves the recruitment of unaffiliated truck drivers based in the United States to smuggle migrants across the SW border. This is advantageous to the smuggling networks because crossing the SW border presents one of the largest risks of apprehension by law enforcement associated with the journey.
