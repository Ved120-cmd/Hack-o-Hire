CMLNs are considered professional money launderers (PMLs)3 and play a vital role in laundering the Cartels’ drug proceeds in the United States. This is, in part, due to the speed and effectiveness of CMLNs’ money laundering operations, as well as their willingness to absorb financial losses and assume risks for the Cartels and other clients.4 Further, CMLNs operate around the world and may coordinate with other international PMLs, such as shadow banking networks and",

A primary goal of CMLNs is to obtain large quantities of USD and other currencies to meet the demand for these currencies by Chinese citizens seeking to evade the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC’s) currency controls.15 This demand for USD has led CMLNs to partner with illicit actors, such as the Cartels, who have access to large sums of USD that they need to launder.16 CMLNs assume much of the risk of transporting and laundering large volumes of cash inside the United States, while providing near-instant transfers of value back to their clients by engaging in informal value transfer",

Although CMLNs generate some profit from their money laundering activities (e.g., payment from the Cartels), CMLNs are typically able to offer lower rates than other PMLs because most CMLN revenue comes from selling the illicit cash to Chinese citizens at a high rate.21 In addition to laundering drug proceeds on behalf of the Cartels, CMLNs are associated with the laundering of proceeds from other types of illicit activity on behalf of clients, such as marijuana 13.

Drivers of Chinese and Cartel Money Laundering The rise in the prominence of CMLNs, including their business relationships with the Cartels and other TCOs, has been driven, in part, by laws passed by the Government of Mexico (GOM) and the PRC, that restrict financial flows.

This policy has driven Chinese citizens to increasingly rely on the services of CMLNs to provide access to USD through informal transactions.

F I N C E N A D V I S O R Y 5 Financial Typologies Associated with CMLNs Laundering Illicit Cartel Proceeds CMLNs’ Use of Mirror Transactions To launder funds, CMLNs transfer value globally and sometimes simultaneously using a form of IVTS. For example, once a U.S.-based CMLN receives USD from a Cartel for laundering, it coordinates with Mexico-based CMLN counterparts who conduct a reciprocal or “mirror transaction,”28 in which an equivalent amount of pesos is transferred to the Cartels’ Mexico-based accounts, minus a nominal fee. Through this informal value transfer, CMLNs “purchase” the value of the Cartels’ illicit",

This mirror transaction occurs nearly instantly and avoids many of the risks involved with cross-border bulk cash smuggling or with depositing large sums of USD in Mexico-based financial institutions and thereby circumvents Mexico’s USD deposit restrictions. CMLNs may also use convertible virtual currency (CVC) as an alternative means to conduct mirror transactions with the Cartels.29 Similar to other mirror transactions, use of CVC avoids the risks associated with physical transportation of cash or depositing bulk USD. The U.S.-based CMLNs then sell the USD purchased from the Cartels, by advertising it on social media or leveraging personal networks, to Chinese citizens or businesses seeking to evade the PRC’s currency control laws.30 Once identified, the buyer is connected by the U.S.-based CMLN to a China-based operator, who instructs the buyer to transfer an",

Once the transfer is made in China, the U.S.-based CMLN makes the purchased USD available to the Chinese buyers in the United States, typically by laundering the cash through the U.S. financial system. Use of Money Mules As part of the laundering process, CMLNs may use money mules to deposit the illicit USD into accounts they are directed to open at U.S. depository institutions, or at accounts held by U.S.-based Chinese nationals or businesses.32 In situations where the money mules are opening accounts, 28.
