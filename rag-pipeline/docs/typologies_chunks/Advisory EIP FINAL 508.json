Victims are asked for personal or banking information under the guise that the information is needed to receive or speed up their EIP. Fraudsters then use the information obtained to commit various crimes, such as identity theft and the unauthorized access of bank accounts.5 • Altered checks: Fraudsters deposit altered EIP checks, often via automated teller machine (ATM) or mobile device. These altered checks may modify the name of the payee, or leave the name blank, and the amount may be altered prior to deposit. There is reporting of checks being chemically altered so the original payee is removed. • Counterfeit checks: Fraudsters deposit counterfeit EIP checks, often via ATM or mobile device. Fraudsters have various methods",

In line with a risk-based approach to compliance with the BSA, financial institutions also are encouraged to perform additional inquiries and investigations where appropriate. FinCEN has identified the financial red flag indicators described below to alert financial institutions to potential fraud and thefts related to EIPs as well as to assist financial institutions in detecting, preventing, and reporting suspicious transactions related to such activities. Such financial red flag indicators may include: Fraudulent, altered, counterfeit, or stolen EIP checks, Automated Clearing House (ACH) deposits, and prepaid debit cards An account holder attempts to deposit one or more checks that appear to be issued by the U.S. Treasury, but are fraudulent or counterfeit checks.8 When questioned, the customer may disclose that he or she: (i) was sent a partial payment, and needed to verify his or her PII or financial information before receiving the full EIP; or",

An existing account receives, or an account holder makes, multiple EIP-related deposits for individuals other than the account holder(s), and the individuals named on the checks reside outside the geographic region of the account holder, or do not have a history at the account holder’s purported address. This may be indicative of funnel account activities in which multiple EIPs are deposited or transferred throughout the United States into one account, which may be held by a fraudster or a money mule working for the fraudster.
