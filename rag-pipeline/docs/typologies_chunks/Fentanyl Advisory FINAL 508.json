This Advisory should be shared with: • Chief Executive Officers • Chief Operations Officers • Chief Risk Officers • Legal Departments • Chief Compliance/BSA Officers • AML Officials • Sanctions Compliance Officials • Cybersecurity Units Introduction The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this advisory1 1. This advisory is also part of a larger, United States government Fentanyl advisory covering the movement, manufacturing, marketing, and monetary aspects of the trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.",

One common thread among these transactions is the potential use of mailing and shipping systems to disseminate fentanyl. Traffickers regularly ship fentanyl and its analogues through the mail to drug dealers and users in the United States.

In practice, this can be achieved through the misrepresentation of the price, quantity or quality of imports or exports.
