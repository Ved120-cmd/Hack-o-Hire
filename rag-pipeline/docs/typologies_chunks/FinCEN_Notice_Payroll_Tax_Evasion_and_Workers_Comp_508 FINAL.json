Individuals involved in the scheme will set up a shell company whose sole purpose is to allow certain construction contractors to avoid paying workers’ compensation premiums as well as state and federal payroll taxes. 2. The shell company achieves this by engaging in two kinds of fraud: • First, once established, the shell company operators take out a minimal workers’ compensation policy and rents or sells the policy to construction contractors that employ a much larger number of workers than the policy is designed to cover, thereby committing insurance fraud.7 • Second, the shell company operators facilitate tax fraud because the contractors use the shell company to pay their workers “off the books,” and without paying the required state and federal government payroll taxes.8 Each step in these schemes is",

Insurance Fraud Step 1: As described in Figure 1 below, the scheme begins when individuals, usually part of an existing fraud network, recruit others into that network. Step 2: The new recruits establish a shell company purporting to be a legitimate subcontracting construction company and whose existence enables construction contractors with whom it partners to underbid law-abiding construction firms and evade paying the requisite payroll taxes and workers’ compensation premiums. The shell company may also engage in other illicit transactions such as money laundering.9 7. Insurance fraud may occur under state law when a company materially and knowingly misrepresents to insurers the number of its employees and associated payroll to obtain a lower premium. 8.

Based upon Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting and other available information, FinCEN has identified money laundering activity by drug trafficking organizations and transnational criminal organizations that leverage these schemes to launder cash proceeds from their other criminal activity. These schemes are often part of a broader, global money laundering network that inserts cash into the U.S. financial system in small amounts, across a large number of cities, and then collects checks from the involved businesses—including shell",

The insurance policy enables the shell company to apply for and receive official business registration status, which can be verified through the appropriate state authority’s website. Step 4: The shell company then “rents” or sells access to its minimal workers’ compensation policy, along with its business license and any tax documents, to construction contractors (who may be complicit in the scheme), most of whom employ a larger number of workers than what the insurance policy is designed to cover.

Step 1: Construction contractors write checks payable to the shell company which creates the façade that the shell company is performing construction projects.

The individual, Melesio Gomez-Rivera, was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison and three years of supervised release. He was also ordered to pay $29.9 million in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). According to court documents, he owned and operated a residential construction company called Novatos Construction. From January 2014 until December 2017, Gomez-Rivera and several other construction company owners conspired with each other and David A.

To carry out the scheme, Gomez-Rivera and the other company owners cashed or had other individuals cash millions of dollars in payroll checks at various locations of Katz’s check cashing business, used the cash to pay construction workers under-the-table, and filed false business and payroll tax returns. In total, the group cashed approximately $192 million in payroll checks, causing a combined employment and individual income tax loss of $68 million.
