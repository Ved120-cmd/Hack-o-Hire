As part of the FATF’s listing and monitoring process to ensure compliance with its international standards, the FATF identifies certain jurisdictions as having strategic deficiencies in their regimes.1 Financial institutions should consider the FATF’s statements when reviewing their obligations and riskbased policies, procedures, and practices with respect to the jurisdictions noted below.2 1. The FATF (www.fatf-gafi.org) is a 39-member intergovernmental body that establishes international standards to combat money laundering and counter the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The United States is a member of the FATF. 2. See 31 U.S.C. §§ 5318(h) and (i). 3. See",

In response to the measures countries have adopted to contain the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as confinement and travel restrictions, the FATF gave the option for countries publicly identified on the FATF lists of jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies to report their progress at the October 2020 meetings or to defer reporting, in which case their February 2020 statements remain in place.3 Advisory on the Financial Action Task Force-Identified Jurisdictions with Anti-Money Laundering, Combating the Financing of Terrorism, and Proliferation Deficiencies On October 23, 2020, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) updated its list of jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing.

On October 23, 2020, the FATF updated its “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring” statement. Notably, the FATF removed Iceland and Mongolia from the list after the FATF conducted on-site visits to those countries and verified that each country is implementing its reforms. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, not all countries reported to the FATF. Therefore, statements of those jurisdictions that deferred reporting may not necessarily reflect the most recent status in the jurisdiction’s AML/CFT regime.6 Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring: • Remaining on the list: Albania, The Bahamas, Barbados, Botswana, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Ghana, Jamaica, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Syria,",
