Since then, Hizballah and Israel have engaged in persistent cross-border attacks against one another,5 which have forced thousands of civilians to evacuate from their homes in northern Israel and southern Lebanon,6 killed innocent civilians including children,7 and contributed to rising regional tensions and the threat of war.8 Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Filing Request: FinCEN requests that financial institutions reference this alert by including the existing key term “IRANTF-2024-A001” in SAR field 2 (Filing Institution Note to FinCEN) and the narrative and select SAR field 33(a)",
