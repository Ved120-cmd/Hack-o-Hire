FinCEN is aware of ransomware directly targeting vaccine research, and FinCEN asks financial institutions to stay alert to ransomware targeting vaccine delivery operations as well as the supply chains required to manufacture the vaccines. Financial institutions and their customers should also be alert to phishing schemes luring victims with fraudulent information about COVID-19 vaccines. 1.
