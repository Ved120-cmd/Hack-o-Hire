Hamas’s horrific terrorist attack on the people of Israel on October 7, 2023, which left more than 1,000 innocent civilians, including citizens of the United States and dozens of other countries, wounded, killed, or taken hostage,2 was funded by Hamas’s terrorist finance network and practices. Hamas raises funds to support its operations and members in a variety of ways, including through: support from Iran; private donations; a global portfolio of investments; diverting aid and support from legitimate charities;",

A customer or a customer’s counterparty conducts transactions with OFAC-designated entities and individuals, or transactions that contain a nexus to identifiers listed for OFAC-designated entities and individuals, to include email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, or passport numbers, or virtual currency addresses.
