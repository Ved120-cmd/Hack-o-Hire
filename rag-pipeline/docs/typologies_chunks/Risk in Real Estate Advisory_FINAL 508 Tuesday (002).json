The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this advisory to provide financial institutions and the real estate industry with information on money laundering risks associated with certain real estate transactions.

Although FinCEN to date has focused on residential real estate, money laundering can also involve commercial real estate transactions. Each type of financial institution—defined by law to also include “persons involved in real estate closings and settlements”—has certain anti-money laundering obligations and can provide valuable reporting on potential money laundering and terrorist financing.2 2. FinCEN—a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury—administers and issues regulations pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The BSA is the commonly used term for statutory enactments requiring U.S. financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorism finance, and other illegal activity.

While real estate brokers, escrow agents, title insurers, and other real estate professionals are not required to, FinCEN encourages them to voluntarily report suspicious transactions involving real estate purchases and sales. As with other financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), a safe harbor from liability exists with respect to the filing of suspicious activity reports, including voluntary ones, by persons involved in real estate closings and settlements.3 1 F I N C E N A D V I S O R Y 2 Money Laundering Risks in the Real Estate Sector Real estate transactions and the real estate market have certain characteristics that make them vulnerable to abuse by illicit actors seeking to",

For example, many real estate transactions involve high-value assets, opaque entities, and processes that can limit transparency because of their complexity and diversity. In addition, the real estate market can be an attractive vehicle for laundering illicit gains because of the manner in which it appreciates in value, “cleans” large sums of money in a single transaction, and shields ill-gotten gains from market instability and exchange-rate fluctuations.4 4. Money laundering is a crime orchestrated to conceal the source of illegal proceeds so that the money can be used without detection of its criminal source. Visit www.fincen.gov for further information.

This included a hotel, two homes, and a mansion in Beverly Hills, CA; a home in Los Angeles, CA; a condominium, two apartments, and a penthouse in New York, NY; and, a townhouse in London, England; all with a collected value estimated at approximately $315 million.

To this end, money launderers can use a number of vehicles to reduce the transparency of their transactions. One such vehicle, highlighted in the below case study, is the use of shell companies. Shell companies are typically non-publicly traded corporations, limited liability companies (LLCs), or trusts that have no physical presence beyond a mailing address and generate little to no independent economic value.5 5. For further information on shell companies, see FinCEN Guidance FIN-2006-G014 “Potential Money Laundering Risks Related to Shell Companies” (November 2006) and FinCEN’s SAR Activity Review Trends, Tips, and Issues: Issue 1 (October 2000), Issue 2 (June 2001), and Issue 7 (August 2004).

Most shell companies are formed by individuals and businesses for legitimate purposes, such as to hold stock or assets of another business entity or to facilitate domestic and international currency trades, asset transfers, and corporate mergers. Shell companies can often be formed without disclosing the individuals that ultimately own or control them (i.e., their beneficial owners) and can be used to conduct financial transactions without disclosing their true beneficial owners’ involvement. Criminals abuse this anonymity to mask their identities, involvement in transactions, and origins of their wealth, hindering law enforcement efforts to identify individuals behind illicit activity.6 6.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated El Aissami under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.

Lopez Bello is tied to significant property and other assets, which were also blocked as a result of OFAC’s action. The misuse of shell companies to launder money is a systemic concern for law enforcement and regulatory agencies, but it is of particular concern in the “all-cash” segment of the real estate market, which currently has fewer AML protections.
