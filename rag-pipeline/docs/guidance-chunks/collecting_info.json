It is critical that\nthe information provided in a SAR filing be as accurate and complete as possible. The SAR\nform should include any information readily available to the filing institution obtained through\nthe account opening process and during due diligence efforts.\nIn general, a SAR narrative should identify the five essential elements of information – who?\nwhat? when? where? and why? – of the suspicious activity being reported. The method of\noperation (or how?) is also important and should be included in the narrative.",
