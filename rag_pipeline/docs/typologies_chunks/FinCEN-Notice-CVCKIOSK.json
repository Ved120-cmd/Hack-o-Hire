CVC kiosks—also called cryptocurrency (crypto) Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)—are ATM-like devices or electronic terminals that allow customers to exchange real (or fiat) currency for virtual currency and vice versa.2 While CVC kiosks can be a simple and convenient way for consumers to access CVC, scammers and other illicit actors can also exploit their simplicity and convenience. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), criminals engaged in fraud schemes often direct victims to use a CVC kiosk to send payments under false pretenses.",

In 2024, the FBI’s IC3 received more than 10,956 complaints reporting the use of CVC kiosks, with reported victim losses of approximately $246.7 million.3 This represents a 99 percent increase in the number of complaints and a 31 percent increase in reported victim losses from 2023.4 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) likewise identified, based on an analysis of consumer reports, that fraud losses through CVC kiosks have skyrocketed.5 FinCEN, through analysis of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) information, has observed that CVC kiosks have also been used to launder suspected drug proceeds. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reports that transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) such as Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación are increasingly adopting CVC because it enables rapid international funds transfers.6 In areas that face a significant drug-related threat and that have a significant 1.

Illicit activity involving CVC kiosks is linked to fraud, certain types of cybercrime, and drug trafficking organization activity, which are three of FinCEN’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) National Priorities.8 The information contained in this Notice is derived from FinCEN’s analysis of BSA data, opensource reporting, and information from law enforcement partners.

After providing the CVC kiosk with identification, which can range from a phone number to a scan of a government-issued ID, the customer enters the address of the CVC wallet that will receive the purchased CVC. The address could be the customer’s own CVC wallet or that of a third party,12 and is normally embedded in a quick response (QR) code, which is a square barcode that can be scanned and read with a smartphone or kiosk camera.

For example, according to the DEA, large volumes of illicit proceeds are laundered throughout Illinois, with Chicago serving as the primary collection point for U.S. currency generated through illegal drug sales. With the presence of CVC kiosks in the area growing rapidly (with approximately 1,626 in Illinois and 1,167 in Chicago alone), virtual currency continues to be a popular and growing method used to launder illicit proceeds derived from drug sales. Law enforcement reporting indicates that individuals are traveling from other states to Chicago to use these kiosks. See DEA, “The Illegal Drug Threat to Illinois” (Sept. 2024), at pp. 2, 5. 8.

She was also told her personal identifying and bank account information were compromised and was subsequently referred to co-conspirators posing as employees from her financial institutions. The victim was then told she needed to “secure” her assets. At the direction of someone posing as a bank employee, she deposited approximately $55,700 into CVC kiosks located in North County San Diego.

Because no single red flag is determinative of illicit or other suspicious activity, financial institutions should consider the surrounding facts and circumstances, such as a customer’s historical financial activity, whether the transactions are in line with prevailing business practices, and whether the customer exhibits multiple red flags before determining if a behavior or transaction is suspicious or otherwise indicative of illicit activity.
