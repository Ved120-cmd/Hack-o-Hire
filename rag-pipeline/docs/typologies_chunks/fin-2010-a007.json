On June 15, 2010 the Mexican finance ministry, Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público de México (SHCP), announced new anti-money laundering (AML) regulations that will restrict the amounts of physical cash (banknotes and coins) denominated in U.S. dollars that Mexican banks may receive.1 The Mexican regulation will still allow certain transactions up to relatively low value thresholds, as described in more detail below. The regulations do not restrict non-cash transactions denominated in U.S. currency (e.g., wire transfers, ACH",

These new Mexican regulations are intended to mitigate risks of laundering proceeds of crime tied to narcotics trafficking and organized crime. The regulations state that the restrictions on U.S. currency transactions by banks with individuals will go into effect four business days after official publication on June 16, 2010. The restrictions on U.S. currency transactions by banks with legal entities and trusts will go into effect ninety (90) calendar days after official publication (on or about September 14, 2010).2 This Advisory is issued to assist financial institutions in understanding how the U.S financial system may be affected by the changes in the Mexican regulations, to help U.S. financial institutions anticipate possible impacts on their businesses, including the risk profiles of certain classes of transactions and",

There are many legitimate reasons that U.S. currency enters the Mexican economy, including in connection with border trade, tourism, and 1 See SHCP Press Release No. 041/2010 (June 15, 2010), Anuncia la SHCP Medidas para Regularizar la Entrada de Dolares en Efectivo al Sistema Bancario Mexicano, available at http://www.hacienda.gob.mx/SALAPRENSA/doc_comunicados_prensa/2010/Junio/comunicado_041_2010.pdf . 2 Other requirements upon Mexican banks, such as recordkeeping obligations will begin as early as four days after official publication, while additional reporting",

FinCEN and U.S. financial regulators have previously taken steps aimed at raising awareness of the risks involved in the bulk shipment of cash between the United States and Mexico.

Summary of New Mexican Regulation The SHCP has issued the new regulations, in consultation with the Mexican financial supervisor, the Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores, pursuant to Article 115 of the Mexican Law of Credit Institutions, to be included among other AML requirements for banks issued pursuant to article 115.7 (See Annexes for a copy of the new regulations as issued, and an unofficial translation into English.) The regulations provide that Mexican banks shall be prohibited from receiving U.S. currency for transactions involving currency exchange, and for receipt of payment for services, or transfers or remittances of funds, subject to the following conditions: 8 3 In announcing the new regulations (see footnote 1), the SHCP stated that more that 96% of remittances are transferred electronically and paid out in Mexican pesos, while the average remittance value is U.S. $317.
