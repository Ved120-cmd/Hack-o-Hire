See Department of Homeland Security (DHS), “Increasing Threat of Deepfake Identities” (“DHS report”). As noted further by DHS, the threat of deepfakes and synthetic media comes not from the technology used to create it, but from people’s natural inclination to believe what they see, and as a result, deepfakes and synthetic media do not need to be particularly advanced or believable to be effective in spreading misinformation or disinformation. 3.

Recent Developments in Publicly Available GenAI Tools GenAI tools have greatly reduced the resources required to produce high-quality synthetic content, meaning media that has either been created through digital or artificial means or media that has been modified or otherwise manipulated through technology, whether analog or digital.8 In many cases, GenAI can now produce synthetic content that is difficult to distinguish from unmodified or human-generated outputs.
