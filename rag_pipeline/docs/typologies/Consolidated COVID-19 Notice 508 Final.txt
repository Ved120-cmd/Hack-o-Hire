1 FIN-2021-NTC1 February 24, 2021 Consolidated COVID-19 Suspicious Activity Report Key Terms and Filing Instructions The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this Notice to consolidate filing instructions and key terms for fraudulent activities, crimes, and cyber and ransomware attacks related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to remind financial institutions of recent updates to FinCEN guidance concerning Section 314(b). FinCEN has published a series of advisories and notices on COVID-19-related threats to assist financial institutions with the filing of suspicious activity reports (SARs) involving such threats. In this Notice, FinCEN further requests that financial institutions consult the tables below when filing SARs for COVID-19-related activity. Table 1 contains key terms and instructions related to government programs. Table 2 contains a summary of the key terms and instructions for COVID-19-related activities that are not tied to specific government programs. Table 3 provides a list of additional FinCEN’s COVID-19-related publications. Financial institutions that follow the instructions set forth below will assist FinCEN, law enforcement, financial regulators, and other relevant government agencies in identifying and utilizing the information submitted in COVID-19-related SARs. Financial institutions should consult previously published advisories and notices for additional SAR filing instructions related to the advisories and notices included below. If financial institutions wish to cite more than one advisory, then they should use only the FinCEN identification numbers (FINs) listed in the tables below in Field 2, and provide the full references in the SAR narrative. FinCEN requests that filers be as specific as possible in their SAR filings. For instance, if the SAR addresses a government program, FinCEN requests that filers use program-specific keywords, as detailed in the keyword columns in Table 1 below, and avoid relying on generalized key terms, such as “stimulus,” “CARES Act,” or “benefit.” Doing so will expedite identification of relevant SARs for appropriate investigative, analytical, supervisory, and other authorized purposes.
