    "content": "The Bank of Mainland (BM) filed an initial suspicious activity report (SAR)\ndated 6/11/01. The SAR was filed due to unusual wire transfer and cash\ndeposit activity involving two BM corporate customers, Sky Corporation\nand Sea Corporation, both registered in Vermont and having a common\nVermont address. BM has also filed numerous CTRs on cash deposits\nconducted on behalf of the two companies. Our previous and recent\nreviews of the customers’ activities revealed the cash deposits and wire\ntransfers involving the companies might be consistent with money\nlaundering.\nBecause BM was unable to determine any particulars about the\ncompanies in order to establish a business justification for the activity, the\nfollowing patterns appeared suspicious:\n1. A repeating pattern of structured cash deposits into business\naccounts held by the companies with wire transfers to a particular\nbeneficiary.\n2. Individual transactions conducted in large dollar amounts. \n17",
