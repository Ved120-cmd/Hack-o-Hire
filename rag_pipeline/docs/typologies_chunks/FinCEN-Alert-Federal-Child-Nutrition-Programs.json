As part of this program, FNS allocates funds to state agencies. For example, in the state of Minnesota, FNS allocates funds to the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE), which administers and oversees the Federal child nutrition programs in Minnesota.8 MDE contracts with organizations (referred to as “Sponsors”) including schools, child care centers,",
